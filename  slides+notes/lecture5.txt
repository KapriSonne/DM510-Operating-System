Lecture 5
---------------------------
Syscall = call to the kernell, code thats exexuted in kernel land, that user land cant edit
process = program in execution
  - can either be I/O- or CPU-bounded

threads =
Task = process or threads
scheduler -> long-term (job-schedular), short-term (cpu-schedular)

producer-consumer problem:
  - unbounded-buffer
  - bounded-buffer

synchronization:
  - blocking      -> synchronous
  - non-blocking  -> asynchronous
